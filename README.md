# nextpvr-importer

NextPVR allows you to add your own video files to the recordings list by importing an XML file. If you have lots of videos it could take a long time to create the XML file so I have created this to automate the process.


## Installation

I intend to integrate this into my NextPVR server but for now I have created it as a stand alone. First, you will need to set up a server and create a virtual host, then you can put the files in the virtual hosts directory. If you are using Linux you can use my virtual host creator to quickly set one up https://github.com/1Syler/apache-virtual-host-setup

I have tested this on both Linux and Windows, with Firefox and Chrome. Chrome works great but Firefox require some additional setup to get it working and it is unstable so not worth using.
